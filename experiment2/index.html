				<h2>Description</h2>
				<p>I wanted to create a cool spiderweb looking piece with generative design aspects. With this experiement it ended up looking very much like dippin' dots, but I'm very happy with how the designs end up looking with nodes.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Technical</h2>
				<p>This piece works with the user clicking within the canvas and moving the mouse around. No two pieces are alike. The colored circles are the nodes and can attract other nodes and will make connections based on the drawConnections algorithm.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Reflection</h2>
				<p>This piece was straightforward and quick to implement with the help of Mr. ChatGPT. I really love how the spiderweb turned out and the minimal user augmentation. I wanted to add another inspiration piece to my final experiment, however it didn't end up working out because it didn't convey what I wanted to.</p>
