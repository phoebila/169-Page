				<h2>Description</h2>
				<p>This interactive 3D sandbox piece simulates the dynamic behavior of shifting desert dunes and sand particles, creating a playful and visually engaging environment. Users can interact with the scene by clicking to add particles (represented by brown spheres), which react to gravity, wind forces, and terrain collisions. </p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Technical</h2>
				<p>The terrain itself is a grid of shifting dunes, smoothly evolving over time as the sand diffuses and reshapes, thanks to a diffusion algorithm. </p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Reflection</h2>
				<p>This process was a pain in my ass, nothing worked and every iteration was a failure. I ended up just keeping things simple and what worked to create something 3D that users would have fun interacting with.</p>
