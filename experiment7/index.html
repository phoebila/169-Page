				<h2>Description</h2>
				<p>This simulates a robotic arm inspired by Can't Help Myself by Sun Yuan and Peng Yu. The arm consists of three segments, each controlled by sliders in manual mode or by predefined preset movements (wave, grab, drop) in auto mode. Additionally, the arm leaves behind a blood-like fluid effect, mimicking the pieceâ€™s expressive and chaotic motions.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Technical</h2>
				<p> Arm Mechanics: The arm is constructed using lines and angles, with each segment rotating based on slider inputs or preset logic. Trigonometric functions (cos and sin) determine segment positions.
					Modes: The simulation supports manual mode (controlled by sliders) and auto mode, where predefined animations run based on time (millis()).
					Fluid Simulation: A particle system generates red fluid-like dots at the arm's endpoint, decreasing in opacity over time for a fading effect.
					UI Elements: Sliders control joint angles, and buttons toggle between modes and preset actions.</p>

				<h2>Reflection</h2>
				<p>Straightforward piece, wanted to create something simple to have more time for capstone project.</p>
